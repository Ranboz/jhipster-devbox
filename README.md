## Manual installation

This generates a new "development box" directly from this repository.

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-devbox.git`
- It is wise to use a tag to have a stable version: the JHipster DevBox tags are the same as the JHipster Generator tags, so using the DevBox v3.2.0 also means using the generator v3.2.0
- Run `vagrant up`

## <a name="configure"></a> Configure your new box and install new software

Start up the new box:

- Login using the `vagrant`,Password is `vagrant` (please note that default keyboard layout is US!)
